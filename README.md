## What I learned Through this Project- 

- React Component Structure: Building a Netflix clone using React helped me understand how to break down the user interface into smaller, reusable components. This allowed me to better organize my code and improve maintainability.

- State Management with React: Developing the Netflix clone enhanced my understanding of managing state in a React application. I learned how to handle and update state using React's built-in state management with hooks
